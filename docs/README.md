# Cryptonoia

## Description
Cryptonoia is a nascent project aimed at diving into the development within the Solana blockchain ecosystem. This project is my journey towards becoming a proficient cryptocurrency programmer, starting from the basics and gradually building a comprehensive knowledge base. The mission of Cryptonoia is not only to contribute to my growth as a developer but also to enhance the cryptocurrency ecosystem. A unique aspect of Cryptonoia is its commitment to allocating a percentage of the project's earnings to support other initiatives within the network, promoting a culture of mutual support and shared growth.

## Learning Objectives
- To become a skilled cryptocurrency programmer with a strong foundation in the fundamentals of blockchain development.
- To contribute innovative projects to the Solana ecosystem, potentially bringing the power of cryptocurrencies to underserved regions and communities.
- To establish a supportive cycle within the community, where a portion of project earnings is reinvested to help new initiatives thrive.

## Technologies and Tools
As an initial project, all technologies, languages, and tools will be thoroughly researched and decided collectively by collaborators, ensuring transparency and maintaining the project's original focus.

## Project Structure
Cryptonoia is organized into several key directories:

- `/docs`: Contains all project documentation, including this README.
- `/projects`: Home to all sub-projects under Cryptonoia, including:
  - `/token`: Contains the projects focused on token development within the Solana ecosystem. Inside this directory, you'll find:
    - `/cryptonoia_token`: The first token project of Cryptonoia, focusing on the development of a unique Solana-based cryptocurrency token. This folder contains all relevant smart contracts, documentation, and other resources related to the Cryptonoia token.
- `/website`: Contains the files for the project's website.
